# Python-Calculator

Just a fun little project.

Has the MIT License, so you're absolutely free to edit, use (publically), and re-publish this code (edited or original) as long as you credit me (post attribution to me) and don't hold me liable.

Probably isn't amazingly effecient, my entire knowledge of Python is literally from Year 10, 11 & Sixth Form. I try, though!
